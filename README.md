# Design Patterns in GO

There are many design patterns in Go and one can choose from the list based on one's preference and/or usecase.

To get started with them and learn more with examples, Creational Design Pattern is listed in this repo with its different types. Other Design Patterns will be added gradually.

## Creational Design Pattern**
  Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a best-suited way based on our requirements.

  1. **Singleton**
      The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. In short, it ensures a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

  2. **Builder**
      This design pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

  3. **Factory Method**
      This design pattern allows creating an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refers to the newly-created object using a common interface.

  4. **Prototype**
      This design pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
